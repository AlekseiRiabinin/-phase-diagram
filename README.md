# Sensor Data Processing

## 1. Description
The amount of stored data gets larger making it more challenging for data center managers to extract, monitor, and understand information. This escalation has created an increased demand for a more comprehensive data analysis for easier monitoring. One of the parameters that are being monitored is the temperature in industrial facilities and equipment. Thus monitoring evolved from manually logging temperature to digital and smart systems. Today, a new method of temperature monitoring management is developed. Temperature data visualization is now used for a faster representation of data. This system uses graphs and lines that are easier to comprehend. These provide users with tools to extract meaning from data with less significant limitations. As a contribution, this research presents an applied machine learning temperature prediction model for electric arc furnace, which is used for materials production. In general, the methodology proposed considers two steps: first, a data cleaning process to increase the quality of the data, eliminating both redundant information as well as atypical and unusual data, and second, a regression machine learning model to predict the temperatures in the furnace lining.

## 4. Results
The best MAE metrics for temperature prediction are achieved by advanced boosting algorithms: GradientBoosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost. In addition, Feature Importance technique is applied to define the physical input parameters mostly affecting the quality of the machine learning model. This provides the optimal combitation of attributes for each model in order to tune the equipment and finally control mechanical properties of the proceesed material used for high tech industrial applications.
